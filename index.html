                    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;"> <img style="height: 650px; width: 60%" src="https://www.getitaway.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/about-defit.jpeg"></div>
                    <p>The most important thing to do after you sign a new lease or move out after the end of your lease is to perform a make-good and defits. There are many reasons why commercial property owners hire professional assistance to clear out and clean the space before it can be used again. From their safe and sustainable practices and quick response times, you can transform any space and make it as good as new. In the following sections, we’re going to be taking a look at defits, how the process works, and all its benefits.</p>
                    <h2>What Is Defits?</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.getitaway.com.au/de-fits-services-nsw/"><u>Defits</u></a> otherwise known as strip-outs are a pivotal part of the make-good process, which works to convert the space for a new project or revive a current space to its previous state. This commonly occurs at the end of a lease when you are required to reinstate the original appearance of the space or at the beginning of a new lease and aim to keep the current space clear for their next use.</p>
                    <p>The defits process involves a range of steps such as cleaning up the ceiling, flooring, plumbing, and walls so that your space is fully prepared for your next project. In the following section, we’re going to be taking a look at these series of steps from start to finish and all the benefits of performing defits for your space.</p>
                    <h2>What Is The Process Like?</h2>
                    <p>The length of a defits project can vary based on the kind of commercial property you are working on. For instance, defits for commercial or retail areas can last for 2 to a maximum of 5 days. Offices, on the other hand, take around 1 to 2 weeks at most.</p>
                    <p>These series of steps span from:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preparation for laying or relaying the floor coverings</li>
                        <li>Re-painting the ceilings and walls</li>
                        <li>Getting rid of instalments such as decals, fittings, frosting, partitions shelves, signs, tiles, light fittings, fixtures, and more</li>
                        <li>Demolitions</li>
                        <li>Rubbish removal, cleaning, and maintenance</li>
                        <li>Property upkeeping such as air conditioning, electricity, plumbing, and repairs</li>
                        <li>Fire extinguishers report</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Why Are They Essential?</h2>
                    <p>There are many reasons why defits are a good idea for your commercial building whether you’re moving, relocating, or signing a new lease. In the next few moments, we’re going to be taking a look at these benefits below.</p>
                    <h2>Environmentally Conscious</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to a defits project, having professionals perform the clean-up is crucial because they know how to safely and sustainably remove waste from the site area without creating a major environmental impact. They make sure most of the rubbish in the space is recycled, reducing the amount of waste from the project ending up in the landfill.</p>
                    <h2>A New & Revived Appearance For The Space</h2>
                    <p>It’s always good to start or shall we say, restart on a clean new slate. During the defits process, we can guarantee that your space will be good as new, whether you are stripping out a commercial property or office. We have the most expert professionals at hand all of whom can make your property afresh and ready for use.</p>
                    <h2>Getting Everything Done By The End Of The Timeline</h2>
